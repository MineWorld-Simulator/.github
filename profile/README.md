# TrumanCrafts

A Truman's world built with Minecraft.

We've embarked on an exciting journey to develop a Minecraft server that mirrors the real world. This virtual environment is inhabited by hundreds of AI agents, programmed to behave like real humans. They engage in a plethora of activities - they work, communicate, compete, and even construct their own towns and nations, not shying away from initiating wars. Our primary objective is to use this immersive simulator as a testing ground for these AI agents. We're optimistic that this unique experiment may reveal some truly *interesting* findings.

## World Generation

Our World Generator is inspired by [Minecraft Earth Map](https://earth.motfe.net/). It includes terrain, elevation, and biomes.

We've further enriched our simulation by adding features such as **temperature** and **thirst values**:

1. **Temperature**: The world's temperature is determined by its latitude. This feature impacts the following aspects:
   1. **Thirst**: Being in a hot region accelerates thirst.
   2. **Crop growth speed**: Crops grow faster in hotter conditions and cease to grow beyond a certain level of coldness.
   3. If it's too cold and you're not wearing clothes, you will lose health.

2. **Water**: The water is generated by the world's biome.
   1. You must drink boiled water, and the biome must not be marine.
   2. You cannot travel through deep water without a boat.

3. **Terrain**:
   1. Following a 1:35 height ratio, climbing too high mountains will significantly drain your food saturation.
   2. You cannot break too deep into the ground layers (the time for digging through soil/rock layers increases).

## Simulation

We are leveraging [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) to orchestrate the bot's movements and actions. Rather than utilizing rudimentary controls like `wasd`, we are employing a script interface to guide our bot, drawing inspiration from [Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291).

Our approach will incorporate GPT-4 and `ChatGPT function calls` for bot control. We'll even use `GPT-4 with vision` to generate the scripts.
